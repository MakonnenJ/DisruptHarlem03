	<h1>My name is Makonnen Jackman.</h1>
	<p> I'm a 24 year old from Harlem. My passions are music, sports, and learning.
	I'd like to learn the basic elements of programming and then later teach myself in-depth. Ultimately with this knowledge I'd like to create things that could help other people.</p>
